h1. Google wave robot for notifying github commits

h2. Intro

Just a weekend fun project I decided to dump here if anyone was planning on doing same. I don't normally code java so it might be fugly to some. 
Basically you add the robot to your wave where your repo name is the only text, once its added it will reply with a url to add to repo post hook in github.
When you commit the robot will reply to the wave with the commit message. Can be extended to provide more useful info. 

Taken a lot of concepts and ideas from messy robot / wavelive.
